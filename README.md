Hi! Iâ€™m Can KeÃ§ilioÄŸlu, a software developer specializing in autonomous driving algorithms and simulations. My current focus is on mapping, localization, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). I work with ROS2, Python, and C++ to develop autonomous navigation and control systems.

Previously, I gained experience in frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), game development (Unity, C#), and blockchain (Solidity, TypeScript). Iâ€™ve also participated in hackathons like ETHGlobal Scaling Ethereum and Frameworks, delivering successful projects.

Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and learning from the community. Feel free to connect and check out my work! ðŸš€
